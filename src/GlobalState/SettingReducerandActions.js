 * Arguments:
 *    @state: the current state of the app (like above, it contains the min and sec)
 *    @action: the "description" about what you want to do with the state

 *        and implements the logic for that action
 *
 * Return Value:
 *.       return a new state. In this case, it's an object that contains "min" and "sec"
