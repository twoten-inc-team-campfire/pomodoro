### What this does
The only changes in this branch is in `package.json` file. It enables auto document generation. 
It puts no effort on the developers to obtain auto documentation generation. First, run `npm install`, then just run `npm start`. All documentation go under `./doc/`

### What you need to do to see the documentation
Open the `./doc/` folder. Then double click the `index.html`. It will bring up a static website that contains the documentations.
In case you don't know the convenient way to open a folder in terminal, it is `open <path-to-dir>`

### Play with it
Change the documentation in the code, wait a few seconds (it takes a few seconds to compile the code), and refresh the static website.
