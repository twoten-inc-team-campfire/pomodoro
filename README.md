## How to run the test suite
1. Clone the repository
2. Change directory into the repository
3. Install node modules locally: ```npm install```
4. Fire up the Jest test runner: ```npm run test```
5. Use Jest commands to run tests: ```a``` will run all tests and ```q``` will quit Jest. 
You can leave Jest running while you make changes to the code or tests. Jest will rerun tests as soon as it detects that new changes are saved to a file.
