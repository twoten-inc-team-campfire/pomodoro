# TwoTen Inc. Pomodoro Timer

In a world that wrongly praises the skill of multitasking, some of us believe that dedicated focus on a single task is the only way to get things done. Our periods of productive work are poisoned by context switching between emails, text messages, small fires, and dozens of to-doâ€™s that should have been to-done last week. When we try to juggle too many things at once, we end up dropping the ball on all of them. Our software solution is two pronged: first, an automated Pomodoro Timer to provide a convenient method for individuals to stick to single tasks, and second, a time tracking system that individuals can leverage to make informed decisions about their study and work habits
